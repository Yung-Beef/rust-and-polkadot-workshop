# An Introduction to Cryptography for Blockchain

Cryptography is not a trivial topic to teach.

You could spend an entire lifetime going deep into the details of and contributing to the space of cryptography.
That is NOT the intention of this content.

Instead, this content is intended to introduce concepts in cryptography which are heavily used in blockchains:

1. [Hash Functions](pre-rust/crypto/hash.md)
2. [Hash Based Structures](pre-rust/crypto/hash-structures.md)
3. [Digital Signatures](pre-rust/crypto/signatures.md)

We will not attempt to explain HOW these different primitives work, but instead just explain the properties of these primitives and how these properties can be used to achieve our desired outcomes.

More crypto topics could be covered to understand blockchains better, but consider this the minimal baseline knowledge needed for this workshop.
