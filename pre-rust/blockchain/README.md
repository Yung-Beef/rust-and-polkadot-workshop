# An Introduction to Blockchains

This introduction to blockchain attempts to build up knowledge through the history and development of blockchain technology today.

1. We start with an [introduction to Bitcoin](pre-rust/blockchain/bitcoin.md), the very first blockchain, and the problems that it tried to solve.
2. Then we look at [Ethereum](pre-rust/blockchain/ethereum.md), which is a next major evolution of blockchain technology after Bitcoin.
3. Finally, we try to generalize some of the concepts around [blockchain architecture](pre-rust/blockchain/architecture.md) based on what we learned from Bitcoin and Ethereum.

We will extend our deep dive into blockchain technology when we start to teach about Polkadot in the second half of this workshop.
